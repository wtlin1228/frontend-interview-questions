# Subset Sum

Given a set of positive numbers, determine if there exists a subset whose sum is equal to a given number ‘S’.

Input: {1, 2, 3, 7}, S=6
Output: True
The given set has a subset whose sum is '6': {1, 2, 3}

## Basic solution

time complexity: `O(2 ^ N)`
space complexity: `O(N)`

## Bottom up

time complexity: `O(N * C)`
space complexity: `O(N * C)`
