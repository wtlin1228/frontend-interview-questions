/**
 * Unique Generalized Abbreviations (hard)
 *
 * Given a word, write a function to generate all of its unique generalized abbreviations.
 *
 * Generalized abbreviation of a word can be generated by replacing each substring
 * of the word by the count of characters in the substring. Take the example of “ab”
 * which has four substrings: “”, “a”, “b”, and “ab”. After replacing these substrings
 * in the actual word by the count of characters we get all the generalized
 * abbreviations: “ab”, “1b”, “a1”, and “2”.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: "BAT"
 * Output: "BAT", "BA1", "B1T", "B2", "1AT", "1A1", "2T", "3"
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: "code"
 * Output: "code", "cod1", "co1e", "co2", "c1de", "c1d1", "c2e", "c3", "1ode", "1od1", "1o1e", "1o2",
 * "2de", "2d1", "3e", "4"
