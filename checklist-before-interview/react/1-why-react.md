# Why React

1. Maintained by Meta
1. Strong community
1. Good performance
1. Good development experience

## Maintained by Meta

Meta is a big tech company. And they use React to develop their own products.

## Strong community

React team forms working groups to provide support to the community through the release.
For example, React team invited the library maintainers of external state management to
discuss how to support the concurrent features. Like: how to avoid "tearing".

Many new libraries and frameworks are built on React instead of introducing a new one.
Like: Next.js and Remix

## Good performance

- The diffing algorithm (reconciliation)
- Concurrent features like `Suspense`, `Concurrent Rendering` and `Streaming Server Rendering`

## Good development experience

From class components to functional components with hooks, React keeps providing us new APIs
to build a better mindset of developing UI components.
