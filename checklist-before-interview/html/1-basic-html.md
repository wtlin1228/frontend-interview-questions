# Basic HTML

## Describe HTML layout structure.

Every web page has different components to display the intended content and a specific UI. But still, there are few things which are templated and are globally accepted way to structure the web page, such as:

- `<header>`: Stores the starting information about the web page.
- `<footer>`: Represents the last section of the page.
- `<nav>`: The navigation menu of the HTML page.
- `<article>`: It is a set of information.
- `<section>`: It is used inside the article block to define the basic structure of a page.
- `<aside>`: Sidebar content of the page.

## What are Semantic Elements?

Semantic elements are those which describe the particular meaning to the browser and the developer. Elements like `<form>`, `<table>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, etc., are semantic elements.

## What is Microdata in HTML5?

Microdata is part of the `WHATWG` HTML Standard and is used to nest metadata within existing content on web pages. Search engines and web crawlers can extract and process microdata from a web page and use it to provide a richer browsing experience for users.
