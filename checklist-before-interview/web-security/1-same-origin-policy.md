# Same-origin policy

The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.

Two URLs have the same origin if the protocol, port (if specified), and host are the same for both.

Used to prevent cross-site-scripting.
